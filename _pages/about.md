# My PhD

<img style="float: right; padding: 10px 10px 10px 10px;" src="images/Bio/Thruster_firing.png" title="Diagnostic of an Electric Thruster" >

I earned my PhD within the [Department of Physics (DPHY)](https://www.onera.fr/en/dphy-research-units) at the [French Aerospace Lab (ONERA)](https://www.onera.fr/en), where I collaborated with the Sensors and Micro/Nano Technologies (CMT) team and the Lightning, Plasmas, and Applications (FPA) team. My research focused on developing a MEMS sensor to measure the thrust of electric spacecraft inside their plasma plumes during on-ground experiments and testing.I designed and created the sensor, filed a patent for the technology, and presented my work at multiple conferences. I also applied the sensor to an ECR (Electron Cyclotron Resonance) thruster developed at ONERA and conducted plasma simulations to support and validate the experimental results. This work was financed by the [French Space Agency(CNES)](https://cnes.fr/en) and the thesis was delivered by the [University of Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en).

I hold a Master of Engineering in Applied Physics from [Télécom Physique Strasbourg](https://www.telecom-physique.fr/en/school/about-us/), France. I specialized in applied physics, sensors, and electronics. It included hands-on projects such as designing an experimental rocket, designing a solar-powered drifting buoy, using webcam to measure the energy of radiative particles, and manufacturing OLED cells. I interned at the [Dutch Institute for Fundamental Energy Research (DIFFER)](https://www.differ.nl/), where I used Machine Learning to create a database of novel 2D materials.


I completed my final year at the [National Institute for Nuclear Science and Technology (INSTN)](https://instn.cea.fr/en/) in Cadarache, France. My studies began with courses in nuclear physics theory, instrumentation, and thermal hydraulics, providing a solid foundation for understanding nuclear reactor behavior and associated safety measures. Due to the institute's location, I had the unique opportunity to visit several advanced nuclear facilities, including the Tokamak West fusion reactor, the Jules Horowitz Reactor for materials testing, and a nuclear waste recycling plant. I gained experience as a Nuclear Engineer intern at [TechnicAtome](https://www.technicatome.com/en/), where I analyzed thermal hydraulics and naval nuclear reactor behavior, contributing to design improvements for future models. 



# Interests


I had the opportunity to be an EMT volunteer at the Protection Civile of Paris for 3 years. I staffed first aid stations, immediately treating those in need, and actively responded to situations of disaster. Sharing a shift with the SAMU and the Paris Fire Brigade during emergency responses was unforgetable experiences that I shared alongside incredibly people. One of the most exciting experiences of my volunteer life was being part of the team for the Paris 2024 Olympic Games, where I had the privilege of offering emergency medical care during such a world-famous event.

    I earned my PhD within the [Department of Physics (DPHY)](https://www.onera.fr/en/dphy-research-units) at the [French Aerospace Lab (ONERA)](https://www.onera.fr/en), where I collaborated with the Sensors and Micro/Nano Technologies (CMT) team and the Lightning, Plasmas, and Applications (FPA) team. My research focused on developing a MEMS sensor to measure the thrust of electric spacecraft inside their plasma plumes during on-ground experiments and testing.I designed and created the sensor, filed a patent for the technology, and presented my work at multiple conferences. I also applied the sensor to an ECR (Electron Cyclotron Resonance) thruster developed at ONERA and conducted plasma simulations to support and validate the experimental results. This work was financed by the [French Space Agency(CNES)](https://cnes.fr/en) and the thesis was delivered by the [University of Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en).

I hold a Master of Engineering in Applied Physics from [Télécom Physique Strasbourg](https://www.telecom-physique.fr/en/school/about-us/), France. I specialized in applied physics, sensors, and electronics, and completed my final year at the [National Institute for Nuclear Science and Technology (INSTN)](https://instn.cea.fr/en/), focusing on nuclear engineering. My univeristy education included hands-on projects such as designing an experimental rocket, designing a solar-powered drifting buoy, using webcam to measure the energy of radiative particles, and manufacturing OLED cells.

Professionally, I gained experience as a Nuclear Engineer intern at [TechnicAtome](https://www.technicatome.com/en/), where I analyzed thermal hydraulics and nuclear reactor behavior, contributing to design improvements for future models. Earlier, I interned at the [Dutch Institute for Fundamental Energy Research (DIFFER)](https://www.differ.nl/), where I used Machine Learning to create a database of novel 2D materials.

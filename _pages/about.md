I earned my PhD within the [Department of Physics (DPHY)](https://www.onera.fr/en/dphy-research-units) at the [French Aerospace Lab (ONERA)](https://www.onera.fr/en), where I collaborated with the Sensors and Micro/Nano Technologies (CMT) team and the Lightning, Plasmas, and Applications (FPA) team. My research focused on developing a MEMS sensor to measure the thrust of electric spacecraft inside their plasma plumes during on-ground experiments and testing.

I hold a Master of Engineering in Applied Physics from [Télécom Physique Strasbourg](https://www.telecom-physique.fr/en/school/about-us/), France. I specialized in applied physics, sensors, and electronics, and completed my final year at the [National Institute for Nuclear Science and Technology (INSTN)](https://instn.cea.fr/en/), focusing on nuclear engineering. My univeristy education included hands-on projects such as designing an experimental rocket, designing a solar-powered drifting buoy, using webcam to measure the energy of radiative particles, and manufacturing OLED cells.

Professionally, I gained experience as a Nuclear Engineer intern at [TechnicAtome](https://www.technicatome.com/en/), where I analyzed thermal hydraulics and nuclear reactor behavior, contributing to design improvements for future models. Earlier, I interned at the [Dutch Institute for Fundamental Energy Research (DIFFER)](https://www.differ.nl/), where I used Machine Learning to create a database of novel 2D materials.

One way to measure the thrust of an electric thruster is to use a probe measuring the momentum flux in 
the plasma plume. One can ask how the probe alters the plasma properties and if the momentum flux 
measurement remains accurate. In this study, we address this issue by considering a cold gas source.
Experimental momentum flux measurement are compared to a Direct Simulation Monte-Carlo of the 
experiment. We show that the momentum flux measurements depend on the nature of the interaction 
between the particles and the probe surface. Additionally, the design of the housing protecting the sensor 
can increase particles' backflow and alter the measure. Therefore, to have an accurate momentum flux 
measurement, the sensing part of the sensor needs to be exposed to the plume without a casing nearby.

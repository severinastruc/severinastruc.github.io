A probe is developed to measure the thrust of an electron cyclotron resonance thruster (ECRT). A controlled arm holds the probe in the plasma produced by the thruster. It is composed of two quartz micro-mechanical systems (MEMS) used as a pressure sensor. In addition to the plasma pressure, multiple perturbation forces such as the mechanical noise from the pump, electrostatic forces or neutral gas accumulation, affect the sensors. In this study, we show how the performance of the probe is increased against these perturbations and how we measure the pressure.
